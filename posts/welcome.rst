At the end of the month, ``texture.design`` will graduate from its ``Sparkâœ¨`` phase and proceed into its ``SeedðŸŒ±`` phase!  In the meantime, it's the perfect time to show what weâ€™ve been prototyping, share what we learned, and explain where itâ€™s going...

What is texture.design?
=======================
``texture.design`` is a start-up on a quest to reinvent texture synthesis.  It's one of many spin-outs from ``creative.ai``, three of which were funded by the Vienna Business Agency along with angel investors here in Austria. _(The other two projects remain in their protective cocoons for now!)_

Which phase is the project in?
==============================
``Sparkâœ¨`` is what we call the pre-seed phase; for us it involved setting clear intentions what we want the project to become.  It doesnâ€™t have to be formal, in fact it's been rather playful: lots of prototyping, discussions, studying to understand the space!

In the past I didnâ€™t take enough time for this part.  Itâ€™s so easy to rush along eagerly, skip a few steps, and regret it later...  Now I know better ;-) Plus it helps that we gave this phase a name for ourselves: ``Sparkâœ¨``!

Where can I find more?
======================
